Hi, everyone. 🌞🌙

Between day and night, I design and build systems that actually ship — from web applications to automations and AI-powered workflows.

---

## About me

- Full-stack developer focused on **web applications, automation and AI**
- Experienced in integrating tools like **n8n**, **Kommo (amoCRM)** and custom APIs
- Comfortable working across **frontend, backend and integrations**
- Oriented toward **scalable, maintainable systems** rather than quick hacks

---

## Focus areas

- Design and development of **SaaS dashboards** and internal tools  
- **Business process automation** using n8n and third-party APIs  
- **CRM workflows** (Kommo and others) integrated with email, chat, payments and AI  
- AI-assisted flows: lead qualification, messaging, content and data enrichment  
- E-commerce / product flows: checkout, orders, payments, analytics

## Tech stack

**Frontend**

- React, Next.js  
- TypeScript, JavaScript  
- Tailwind CSS / modern component libraries  

**Backend & APIs**

- Node.js (Express / Nest or similar)  
- REST APIs, webhooks, background jobs  
- Authentication, authorization, multi-tenant patterns  

**Automation, CRM & AI**

- n8n for workflow automation and integrations  
- Kommo (amoCRM) for sales pipelines and automation  
- API-based **LLM / AI** integrations (assistants, chatbots, tools, agents)  

**Data & Infrastructure**

- PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Supabase  
- Docker, basic CI/CD and cloud deployment workflows  
- Git, GitHub and branch-based collaboration  

## How I work

- Break complex projects into small, incremental deliverables 
- Prefer simple, transparent architectures over unnecessary complexity  
- Write code and workflows that are documented, testable and easy to extend
- Communicate clearly about trade-offs, constraints and timelines  

Thanks for reading.
